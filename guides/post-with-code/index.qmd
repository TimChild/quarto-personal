## Executing code with quarto

Quarto makes it easy to include executable code within documents. For example:

Including
````md
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
````

Produces:

```{python}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

---

The output of the code is executed and included in the document.

See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html) for more examples.

For example, including figures is a really nice feature.

### Matplotlib

```{python}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: "A caption can even be included"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.title('A simple plot')
plt.show()
```

### Plotly

And it work with plotly too!

```{python}
#| label: fig-plotly
#| fig-cap: "Using plotly instead of matplotlib"

import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", 
                 color="species", 
                 marginal_y="violin", marginal_x="box", 
                 trendline="ols", template="simple_white")
fig.show()
```
