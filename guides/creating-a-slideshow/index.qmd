## Overview

This is a quick guide to creating a new slideshow using the revealjs format in Quarto.

::: {.aside}
I also have a task for creating a standalone revealjs presentation host by my [webserver](https://github.com/TimChild/webserver-template), but that doesn't take advantage of additional Quarto formatting extensions.

See a demonstration at [demo-presentation.qmd](demo-presentation.qmd).

## Frontmatter

For a full reference, see the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html).

Something like this should generally work well as a starting point:

```markdown
---
title: "My Slideshow"
format: revealjs
---
```
