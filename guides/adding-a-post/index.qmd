# How to add more posts

How to add a new post to the site.

## Creating a new post

In `~/dotfiles/quarto-site/guides/` add a new directory with a `.qmd` file that contains 
frontmatter like

```yaml
---
title: "Adding a post"
date: "2025-02-12"
categories: [code, dotfiles]
---
```

Then just write the content in markdown and quarto will handle the rendering.

## Deploying changes

Run `task quarto:deploy-dotfiles` to deploy the changes.
