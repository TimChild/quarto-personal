E.g. [Demo](/presentations/demo-presentation.html).\n\nUsing the `.qmd` extension in the link will default to the `.rjs` extension upon rendering.\n\nTo override the defaults, or futher customize the slideshow, you can do so by adding:\n\n\n```{qmd}\n---\n...\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    theme: \"white\"\n    transition: \"slide\"\n    ...\n  html: default\n---\n```\n\n\nFor a full list of options, see the [revealjs documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe `format` option at the `document` level is [special](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#metadata-merging) and merges slightly differently. If it is specified, then **only** the output types specified will be produced. \n\nAbove, adding `html: default` means that the default behaviour of producing both a revealjs and html version of the document will be maintained, however if `html` was not specified, then only the revealjs version would be produced.\n:::\n\n## Accessing the presentation\n\nThe presentation will be available at the same path as the `.qmd` file, but with the `.html` extension. E.g. `https://<site-name>/presentations/my-slideshow.html`.\n\nBecause it is not in the `guides` directory, it will not show up in the guides index page. It is possible to link to the presentation from the guides though. Simply add add a link, e.g.:\n\n`[My Slideshow](/presentations/my-slideshow.html)`\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## Using a relative link\nIt's also possible to use relative links. E.g.\n\n`[My Slideshow](../../presentations/my-slideshow.html)`\n\n[My Slideshow](../../presentations/demo-presentation.qmd)\n\nBut from a guide you'll have to go up two levels first. It's generally easier to follow if it just starts from the project root using `/`.\n:::\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Mermaid diagrams in Chrome\n\nCurrently (2025-02-20) google chrome does not always load mermaid diagrams properly (you'll see either an obvious error message or something like `ã€Œ`)[^1]\n\n\n[^1]: I'm not sure exactly what the conditions are that lead to the rendering errors, as it seems to be working as I am writing this guide...\n\n",
