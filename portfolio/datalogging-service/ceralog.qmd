TODO: 
- This follows on from [the previous post](ceraserver.qmd)
- The part gives an overview of the data-logger part that uses a Raspberry Pi and a python script to record environmental data from attached sensors, and send that data to the central server (from the previous post) via a REST API.
- Some minimal details on setting up the RPi
- Some discussion of using UV to run the script
- Setting up the Systemd service to run the script on boot
- Controlling the on-board LED to indicate issues via flash codes.
- The deployment procedure (taskfile task to scp files and ssh execute commands etc.)


## RPi Service

The 

- Write about the RPi Python service
	- Measurement devices can be connected via GPIO (or other ways, but this is particularly convenient on RPi/arduino type devices). 
	- The choice of RPi makes it easy to use a python script and has some benefits with setting up initial wifi connection when prototyping locally. It's definitely massively overkill for what it needs to do. I'd definitely re-write in C for use on a much simpler and cheaper arduino if an significant scale is required, but for now, the ease of python is a good compromise.
	- The python script is simple but effective
		- Some error handling
		- Should add a rolling log (so that data can be uploaded when connection resumes if internet is lost)
		- Should start recording it's own timestamp (and then the server can store both server time and node time)
		- POSTs data to the endpoint periodically.
