TODO: 
- This follows on from [the previous post](ceraserver.qmd)
- The part gives an overview of the data-logger part that uses a Raspberry Pi and a python script to record environmental data from attached sensors, and send that data to the central server (from the previous post) via a REST API.
- Some minimal details on setting up the RPi
- Some discussion of using UV to run the script
- Setting up the Systemd service to run the script on boot
- Controlling the on-board LED to indicate issues via flash codes.
- The deployment procedure (taskfile task to scp files and ssh execute commands etc.)
