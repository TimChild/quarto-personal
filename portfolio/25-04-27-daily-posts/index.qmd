This is is the beginning of an experiment I want to carry out. I want to dedicate a set amount of time each day to working on either a specific aspect of of a side project I have, or just generally learning something new. Then set aside some time to write a short summary on the progress/findings.


## Daily post plan

Here's a little overview of the plan:

- **ML Monday** -- I'm including AI within ML, so this could be anything from the fundamentals of Machine Learning (regression, etc.) to LLM workflows with LangChain, to cloud APIs for computer vision, etc.
	- [Implementing Functional LangGraph with MCP](../25-04-28-ml-monday-lg-with-mcp/index.qmd)
- **Tech Stack Tuesday** -- A backend/infrastructure focus, e.g. anything from the low level integration of a relational database into the project app, to trying out new infrastructure deployment workflows with AWS CDK.
- **Web Wednesday** -- Work on the frontend aspects of the app or new lambda api endpoints.
- **Third-party Thursday** -- Focus on integrating or investigating third party tools, for example, exploring new MCP servers.
- **Frontend Friday** -- Similar to Wednesday
- **Server Saturday** -- Cloud infrastructure, maybe with a focus on improving monitoring or efficiency of scaling etc.
- **Security Sunday** -- Spend additional time improving tests, refactoring code, checking deployment pipelines, permissions granted in IaC etc. Things that overall contribute to the security and stability of application.

There's overlap between the different days on purpose, to allow for flexibility in time management (assuming I continue this for more than a day or two...).


## Brief background

I'm planning for these posts to fall into one of two categories -- development of a side project, or general research/learning. 

In terms of the side project, I've already previously built a perplexity like application, from the low level optimization of code parsing for efficient data ingestion as part of a custom RAG workflow, to the deployment scripts that automate continuous integration tests and deployment to virtual private servers. Plus a bunch of stuff in the middle, like integrating and building monitoring/management tools, etc. 
A lot has changed in the last year, so I want to take this opportunity to try out a new approach, and dive deeper into the newest technologies and developments. I expect I'll find some intersting information and useful tools along the way.

In the times that I'm not focussing on the side project, I plan to just dive into whatever interests me, be in research papers, open source projects, or whatever. Sometimes I just like to learn.
